### SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v1.2

## About

A Github Action to create a .env file with Github Secrets. This is useful when
you are creating artifacts that need to contain secrets stored in Github
Secrets. This creates a file with variables that are defined in the Action
config.

## Usage

The Action looks for environment variables that start with `envkey_` and creates
an envfile with them. These are defined in the `with` section of the Action
config. Here is an example of it in use:

```yml
name: Create envfile

on: [push]

jobs:

  create-envfile:
 
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
 
    steps:
    - name: Make envfile
      uses: SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v1.2
      with:
        envkey_DEBUG: false
        envkey_SOME_API_KEY: "123456abcdef"
        envkey_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
        some_other_variable: foobar
        directory: <directory_name>
        file_name: .env
```

## Inputs

In the example above, there are several key/value pairs that will be added to
the envfile:

| Name                                  | Description                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `envkey_DEBUG`, `envkey_SOME_API_KEY` | These values can be whatever, and they will be added to the envfile as  `DEBUG`  and  `SOME_API_KEY` .                               |
| `envkey_SECRET_KEY`                 | This one will use a secret stored in the repository's Github Secrets, and add it to the file as  `SECRET_KEY`                        |
| `directory` (**Optional**)            | This key will set the directory in which you want to create `env` file. (Action will fail if the specified directory doesn't exist.) |
| `file_name` (**Optional**)            | Set the name of the output envfile. Defaults to `.env`                                                                               |

Assuming that the Github Secret that was used is `password123`, the .env file
that is created from the config above would contain:

```
DEBUG: false
SOME_API_KEY: "123456abcdef"
SECRET_KEY: password123
```

## Potential Issues

### Warnings

When the Action runs, it will show `Warning: Unexpected input(s) ...`. This is
because Github is expecing all the potential input variables to be defined by
the Action's definition. You can read more about it in [this
issue](https://github.com/SpicyPizza/create-envfile/issues/10).
